# Frontend Reference Intro Progress

Date: 2026-06-16 09:34 CST

Linear: N/A

## Done

- Extracted the English and Chinese frontend API reference introduction lines into private renderer helpers.
- Kept the generated frontend API reference text, table sections, contract rows, and row builders unchanged.
- Continued narrowing `render_frontend_api_reference_markdown()` into a renderer that delegates stable prose and table sections through named helpers.

## Verification

- `rtk uv run black src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk uv run python -m py_compile src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk bash scripts/test.bash tests/test_architecture.py::test_frontend_api_reference_manual_matches_sdk_renderer -q`
- `rtk bash scripts/test.bash tests/test_cli.py::test_frontend_api_cli_outputs_reference_markdown -q`
- Generated-reference parity over all 29 `API_CATALOG_SOURCE_ROWS`: no content mismatches, no missing pages; 27 existing non-frontend pages remain trailing-newline-only differences.
- `rtk uv run python .agents/skills/heaven-style/scripts/scan.py src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk bash scripts/flake.bash --ci --paths src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk git diff --check -- src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py docs/progress/2026-06-16-0934-frontend-reference-intro.md`
- Full suite intentionally deferred to keep CPU free for parallel PIHC3 migration workers.

## Risks Or Blockers

- None known for this slice; it is intended as a private renderer refactor only.

## Next

- Continue reviewing adjacent generated-reference renderers for repeated prose or table wiring that can be moved behind stable helpers.
