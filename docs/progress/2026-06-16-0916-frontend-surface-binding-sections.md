# Frontend Surface Binding Sections Progress

Date: 2026-06-16 09:16 CST

Linear: N/A

## Done

- Extracted reusable frontend API reference section helpers for SDK, MCP, CLI, LSP, binding, payload, and workspace-section index tables.
- Replaced English and Chinese renderer call sites with the shared helpers while keeping localized explanatory body text at the call sites.
- Kept frontend API contract rows, generated row builders, and manual reference content unchanged.

## Verification

- `rtk uv run black src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk uv run python -m py_compile src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk bash scripts/test.bash tests/test_architecture.py::test_frontend_api_reference_manual_matches_sdk_renderer -q`
- `rtk bash scripts/test.bash tests/test_cli.py::test_frontend_api_cli_outputs_reference_markdown -q`
- Generated-reference parity over all 29 `API_CATALOG_SOURCE_ROWS`: no content mismatches, no missing pages; 27 existing non-frontend pages remain trailing-newline-only differences.
- `rtk uv run python .agents/skills/heaven-style/scripts/scan.py src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk bash scripts/flake.bash --ci --paths src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py`
- `rtk git diff --check -- src/paradev/sdk/frontend_api.py docs/progress/2026-06-16-0916-frontend-surface-binding-sections.md`
- Full suite intentionally deferred to keep CPU free for parallel PIHC3 migration workers.

## Risks Or Blockers

- None known for this slice; it is intended as a private renderer refactor only.

## Next

- Continue extracting remaining inline frontend API reference table sections into focused private helpers.
